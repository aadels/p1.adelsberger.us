				<p>	I live in Somerville, MA and work in the Communications Department of the <a href= "libraries.mit.edu"> MIT Libraries </a>. 	I am a degree candidate in the ALM Digital Media &amp; Instructional Design program. 
					This will be my last semester of coursework, and in January I start work on my my thesis project. I'm enrolled in
					DGMD E-30 (Video Field Production) as well as CSCI E-15. My programming skills are fairly modest at this point. I took 
					CSCI E-52 last fall and learned basic PHP for my final project. Learning programming in CSCI E-52 was like drinking 
					from a firehose, so I am really looking forward to learning more PHP at what I'm sure will be a challenging but 
					more reasonable pace. I have some experience with GIS and would also like to learn Python in order to take on some more 
					complex projects using ArcGIS. Some of my other interests are cycling, sculpture, and documentary film. I am using Sublime Text.
