			<p>	I live in Somerville, MA and work full time at the <a href= "libraries.mit.edu"> MIT Libraries </a>in the Communications 			Department. I am a degree candidate in the ALM Digital Media &amp; Instructional Design program. 
				Fall 2013 will be my last semester of coursework, and in January I start work on my my thesis project. I'm enrolled in
				DGMD E-30 (Video Field Production) as well as CSCI E-15. My programming skills are fairly modest at this point. I took 
				CSCI E-52 last fall and learned basic PHP for my final project. Learning programming in CSCI E-52 was like drinking 
				from a firehose, so I am really looking forward to learning more PHP at what I'm sure will be a challenging but 
				more reasonable pace. I have some experience with GIS and would also like to learn Python in order to take on some more 
				complex projects using ArcGIS. Some of my other interests are cycling, sculpture, and documentary film.
